Tools to convert video

# Limitations
- Channel layouts that end in `(side)` will not be supported.
- DVD directory/ISO are not yet supported.

# Docker Image
This image supports ripping a video or bluray directory into an MKV using ffmpeg. As a result, 
you'll see in the same directory mapped to `/data` a file with the following naming:
`{TITLE} ({YEAR}) - s{SEASON}e{EPISODE} - {SUBTITLE}.{inputFileName}.mkv`. 
You may want to rip the bluray to mkv before running this tool as ffmpeg is not very good at metadata 
from blurays.

## Examples

### Ripping Bluray using VAAPI
This is currently untested.
```
docker run --rm -it --device /dev/dri:/dev/dri -v /mnt/bluray:/data -e TITLE=Test -e YEAR=2019 rip-video
```

### Ripping specific file without VAAPI
```
docker run --rm -it -v `pwd`:/data -e INPUT=file.mpg -e TITLE=Test -e YEAR=2019 rip-video

```

### Find correct playlist of Bluray
```
docker run --rm -it -v /mnt/bluray:/data --entrypoint /home/ripvideo/scripts/find-playlist.perl rip-video /data
```
